/*Analysis: We are going to use Satterthwaite pool or result since the p-value = 0.0004 < 0.05, which means the varianles are unequal
- confidence interval (226.5 256.4)
- For the hypothesis comparing Smoking Mother and Infant Weight, t-value = 0.0001 and p-value = 0.0004

The conclusion is to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis as the weight of the two categories are significantly different*/

The conclusion is to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis as the weight of the two categories are significantly different*/
